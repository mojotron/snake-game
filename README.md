# SNAKE GAME

This project is recreating classic snake game, but with additional features. Goal of the game is to move snake using arrow keys to eat food and avoid hitting wall or snake itself.

One of my biggest problems is writting readme file. On this project ill strat by writing project plan, pseudo code here before start coding. I usuly get into coding and then after finishing all features, writing readme is pain.

Project plan / pseudo code

- grid -> create grid with dataset attributes on each cell
- snake -> create css snake with 3 parts, head, tail and body. After eating food piece append body block to snake.
- food -> create random fruit(diff food with diff abilities)
- score -> update score depending on food, update and save best score
- rules
- main game loop raF
- user input -> window event for arrow keys
